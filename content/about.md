I did consultancy in:  **_web design, project lead, software engineering_** . Working in an area that i like is essential for me. Having the possibility at the same time to contribute for social causes to which I am sensitive, is a plus. These causes, which mainly concern Africa, then Asia, are:

🎯  **Stopping some diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, or AIDS.** 
  
🎯  **Children&#8217;s education.**
  
🎯  **Reducing the infant mortality rate.**
  
🎯  **Universal health coverage/Equity in healthcare**

In 2016 I launched a graphic and software design agency  **CAMEL** . I worked with a few clients, helped by a team of 5 young talents. Finally i am continuing as a consultant. What I like about being an independent worker is having more freedom, flexibility, and opportunities to develop my skills while learning.

I am very  **creative and inspired** , I have so many ideas for everything that I do not know all the time what to do with it. Do you know someone who wants to buy good ideas? A shortcoming, you will understand, modesty, i don&#8217;t know it. In everyday life you will certainly not notice but internally I have a great appreciation of myself and my talents!

I am a big curious, I always want to learn something new and to extend my knowledge. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a big user of **[udemy.com][1]** . I often take online courses on all areas that you can imagine. But I will quote only the most unusual: a course on the drawing of tiny and cute characters. They&#8217;re called Kawaii characters, and my fellow manga fans surely know what I&#8217;m talking about.

When it&#8217;s outside of work, I&#8217;m more introverted. I much prefer the evenings in front of my TV or my computer than night clubs and parties. On the other hand I particularly like going out to the cinema and restaurants especially with good company.  _Good company = caring & cultivated people  ❤._

I love **travelling**. Discovering new landscapes, new activities, other cultures is fascinating. Of course, even if it is not the most beautiful nor the most developed in the world, my favorite country is mine, Senegal. We are better at home.

I really like music and I only wait for the day when I&#8217;m going to finish deaf because my ears are wearing out. Movies and series, obviously if you have read my publications you will not be surprised to know that this is one of my greatest passions. Take a look at  [my collection of movies and series][2] , you will see if we like the same things! I like to watch a good western on Sunday, a good horror movie when it&#8217;s dark, a good comedy to cheer me up. To make it simple movies are my best friends, that&#8217;s it!

I really like  **karate** , that too should not surprise you. I practice since early 2017. I like this discipline by its code, its strong values, its teachings &#8230;

I am a real bookworm. Cross me at the bookstore and you will see me with a big basket filled with books, and yes, I just can&#8217;t help it, I love books. I do not necessarily find time to read as much as I would like, but the hours I spend reading a good book are delicious.

I like  **technology** globally, one of the main reasons why it became my job. I just feel comfortable in almost every area of ​​digital. I trained on graphic design, and with a little bit of creativity I made some great achievements, I also studied UX (User Experience Design). I learned to develop on a lot of programming languages ​​among others.

I like video games even if I rarely have time to play, I like tennis, swimming &#8230;

> I&#8217;m lucky to have many passions because passions are the joy of life. (Sentence of the year!)

Overall this is what I aspire.

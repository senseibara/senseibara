_OSU !_

## If you read this, know that this is the first article in a long series. The purpose of this article is to give you the reasons that motivate me to make this blog, my goal behind it, **the subjects i will talk about.** {class="blog_post_subtitle"}

&nbsp;

Maybe you want to know a little more about me? Who I am ? What I do for a living ? I thought about that too, but that will not be part of this article. I invite you to go see <a href="https://senseibara.com/en/bara-2">this page</a> instead if you want to find out who is behind this blog.

If I had to use a single term to describe what this blog is going to talk about, this term would be &#8230; **Art**! &#8220;Art&#8221; is a vague word, we agree. But no ! I will not talk about the beautiful paintings of Leonardo da Vinci or the sumptuous symphonies of Franz LIZST, although it would have been nice.

I will talk about things that interest us all, things that we would hate to lose, things that brighten our everyday life, drive away our boredom, engulf us in procrastination that said. These things are:

&nbsp;

<span class = "blog_post_para_title">Movies and series</span>

The theme, which will be the common denominator of the majority of the subjects that I will treat here, is cinema ! Why cinema as the common denominator? The answer is really simple, because it is full of practical examples on all the topics we are going to talk about. It is about developing a more global subject and illustrating it with one or more cinematographic works.

_Those subjects are :_

&nbsp;

<span class = "blog_post_para_title">1. Leadership</span>


OK, this is not an art like the others, you can&#8217;t touch it . But it is real and requires a lot of control. So that will be one of the topics, if not THE subject of which this blog is going to talk the most.

**Why leadership?**

Because it fascinates me to the highest degree! I have read a lot of books about leadership and have long been fascinated by the greatest leaders this world has known, who made or who make history.

Some examples to mention just those: **Winston Churchill (my favorite), Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Elon Musk**, and so on.

Anecdote, the name of the blog refers to the word &#8220;leader&#8221;. Sensei meaning in Japanese &#8220;martial art teacher&#8221;. A sensei is a leader and myself practicing karate, it&#8217;s a nice connection. You know everything now!

&nbsp;

<span class = "blog_post_para_title">2. Books</span>

I read a lot and my readings are for me an inexhaustible source of inspiration. I will rely on most of the great books I have studied to advance some of my theories. Some articles or even sections will be the subject of a topic covered in these books.

Overall I will invite you to read these books but you do not have to read them to understand my articles. A book that most of the future articles will be inspired by much is **&#8220;The laws of power&#8221; Robet Greene**. I&#8217;ll explain why i love this book and how it inspired me the idea of this blog.

&nbsp;

<span class = "blog_post_para_title">3.  Psychology</span>

Last big topic around which this blog will rely heavily, psychology. Overall you will see that all these topics will have several points of convergence on the articles I intend to treat.

Psychology is also a science that has fascinated me for a while. Understand, anticipate, influence people! Who does not want to have this magical power as obscure as fascinating and formidable?

I will not quote you all categories, otherwise this article will never end! In fact, categories (for the moment) there will be only 10, all well counted. The 3 that I just mentioned will be the ones I will focus on the most. I will occasionally talk about technology and video games, more societal topics, and finally entrepreneurship and the world of work.

Overall these are topics that fascinate me a lot, but it is important to remember that cinema will be my box of examples. And if you are part of the 0% of the population that does not like movies, no worries it will not prevent you from understanding and appreciate my publications. At least not for that reason.If I take an example of a film or character in one of my articles, I would write the example as if to explain it to someone who has not seen the film. You will not have to ask more questions than necessary.

<span class = "blog_post_para_title">Roughly speaking </span>

It&#8217;s a program that excites me personally, I hope you too!

Feel free to comment if you want to share your opinion on one of the articles, this is the goal of this blog. Discuss topics. Otherwise I&#8217;ll talk to myself in front of my mirror &#8230;

OSU!

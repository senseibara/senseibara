## Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero, is remembered as a tyrant. A cold-blooded monster who murdered members of his own family and persecuted Christians. History has not spared this ‚Äúhitler‚Äù of antiquity. Until today the facts related to him are disputed. Big heart artist or ruthless brute? {class="blog_post_subtitle"}

## **The ambition of a Mother** {class="blog_post_title"}

When Nero was a child, his uncle Caligula was at the head of the Roman Empire. Caligula is cruel, vicious, and has incestuous relationships with her sisters. One of them, Nero‚Äôs mother, Agrippina, was plotting behind his back, to make him fall.¬†

Nero was then entrusted to his aunt. He was a shy, reserved little boy, interested in art since early age. He is passionate about literature, poetry, chariot racing, dance.

But Agrippina, has great ambitions for her son. Legend has it that she consulted Chaldean mages who told her that her son would rule but kill her. To which she replied : ¬†

> "May he kill me, provided he reigns."

When she took him back, she handed him over to the Stoic philosopher Seneca, who became his preceptor.

After several conspiracies, **Caligula was finally murdered**. Agrippina married Claudius, the successor to the empire.

## **Ascension to power** {class="blog_post_title"}

Agrippina obtains the title of empress **‚ÄúAugusta‚Äù**. She was a strong woman, everything obeyed her. Agrippina is powerful and rich. She can make alliances quickly, and has the army in her favor.

Nero marries Claudius‚Äôs daughter, Octavia. It is a political alliance because it makes Nero, the son-in-law of Claudius. Agrippina then arranges for Claudius to adopt Nero. Something he will do, but it was a huge mistake.

Nero became a rightful heir to Claudius. That being done, Agrippina poisoned Claudius and orchestrated the rise of Nero to power. She played the desperate widow, and kept under her control the children of Claudius. Among them, the biological son of Claudius, Britannicus, Nero‚Äôs rival to the throne.

At 17, Nero came to the head of the greatest empire of antiquity. Part of the prophecy has come true ‚Ä¶

Agrippina still continued to exert her influence and pull the strings. She assassinated all the members of the imperial family to prevent any conspiracy and keep the power.

Agrippina keeps demonstrating that she is the one in charge. She takes initiatives, does actions that only the Emperor has the right to do. She was even engraved on the coins, something that was traditionally reserved for the emperor.

## Love and separation {class="blog_post_title"}

Seneca, his preceptor, gains in influence over Nero and becomes one of his faithful advisers. Seneca worries about Nero‚Äôs sexual blossoming, which is important for his growth (as a sovereign).¬†

The marriage of Nero and Octavia is purely strategic, the two do not love each other and are constantly distant from each other. Seneca pushed him, with Burrus another adviser of Nero, in the arms of Acte a freed slave.

Nero falls in love with the girl and the two secretly see each other quite often. It will help him grow and emancipate. Seneca and Burrus fear more than anything the retaliation of Agrippina. Proud of her affiliation, she can not bear to have her son tie up with a slave.

This created a distance between Nero and his mother.

## The first political acts of Nero {class="blog_post_title"}

Britannicus, biological son of Claudius, was a threat to Nero. Besides, it is no coincidence that Agrippine kept him alive. She used him as leverage against Nero. She reminds him when necessary, that Britannicus has more legitimacy than him. Agrippina could thus keep an influence and an asset.

At a banquet, Britannicus died poisoned. Nero will thus commit his first homicide.

Agrippina loses her trump, and to close the affair, Nero removes her guard and ejected her from the palace. Nero will then begin to fear his mother. She still had political influence and many strategic relationships.

## Love at first sight {class="blog_post_title"}

Nero falls in love with Poppaea. Beautiful and funny, she shared his passion for art. Poppaea was similar to Agrippina, she was addicted to power and did everything possible to gain influence over Nero.

Poppaea became then the mistress of Nero and planned to be his wife and thus become an empress. She had to find a way to take the place of Octavia. But she knew she had to get rid of another woman who barred the road, Agrippina.¬†

Nero‚Äôs mother tried in vain to convince her son to leave Poppea. Nero was more and more afraid of her mother, and Poppea preyed on that. She whispered in her lover‚Äôs ear, cravings for matricide.

Nero had a boat built for his mother, Marvelous in appearance, but designed for shipwreck. The plan worked wonders, unfortunately (or fortunately ‚Ä¶) Agrippine, survived and swam to the coast.¬†

Not suspecting anything, or knowing that her fate was going to be played, she let her son know that she had survived.

She was later killed under Nero‚Äôs orders following accusations of treason. Legend has it that she did not seek to struggle and accepted her fate, as a prophecy that was to come true.

## Uxoricide {class="blog_post_title"}

‚ÄúUxor ‚Ä¶ what‚Äù? I‚Äôm happy to teach you (or not) a new word. Uxor means wife, and Poppea does not wish less than that. Now that Agrippina is dead, all that remained was to remove Octavia.

Nero accused her of sterility, repudiated her, sent her into exile, and married Poppea. Problem solved ! Or maybe not yet‚Ä¶ The people loved Octavia, and her departure was far from appreciated. The pressure of the plebs is so strong that Nero is forced to recall Octavia.

To offer her a palace? A political role? A place in society? Almost‚Ä¶

Octavia is accused of adultery. She would have had a child she aborted with one of Nero‚Äôs preceptors. All that wille being sterile ‚Ä¶ She received the death sentence, and got her veins cut.

This has damaged Nero‚Äôs reputation. At the time, family is sacred by tradition (until now by the way). Nero had decimated all the members of his family.

## Rome is burning üî• {class="blog_post_title"}

July 18, 64, Rome is struck by the heat, the rains are scarce. the aristocrats seek refuge in the countrisides, while the low people suffer in the heat. Fires assault Rome and plunge the city into an uncontrollable collapse.

During this time, Nero stayed in a villa in Antium by the sea. He was alerted and immediately went to Rome.

When he arrived, it was already too late. A dozen neighborhoods in ruins. The deaths are in tens of thousands. The fire remained uncontrollable for several days. ¬†Rome will be marked a lot by this fire. It is often compared to the disaster that ravaged Pompei.

Nero organized help, but was seen guilty. They blamed him for not being there in time. But even worse, suspicions will begin to spring up ‚Ä¶

Nero reconstructed the city, and offered himself, a large golden palace, the Domus aurea. The palace had several distinct buildings, extensive gardens, an artificial lake, a banquet hall, and a golden statue of Nero. Nero would have then said ‚ÄúI finally start being housed like a man‚Äù.

## Charges and persecutions {class="blog_post_title"}

Nero begins to be pointed at. The fires were allegedly triggered under his orders. His goal would have been to destroy the city to give himself the glory of rebuilding it in his image and taste.

Realizing that the people wanted a culprit he then accused the Christians. He declares them responsible for the fire that ravaged Rome. Many of them will be interrogated, arrested, crucified.

## Tarnished image {class="blog_post_title"}

Nero then sees his image tumble. The plebs see him as the invocation of the devil. The aristocrats hate him just as much, but for different reasons.

We are in an era where Rome is in a context governed by the Law of the Strongest. War is a symbol of glory and dominion, every other practice is a sign of weakness. Artists are at the bottom of the hierarchy. Gladiator fights are appreciated.

Nero opposes all the things mentioned above. In reality, the role of ruler is not made for him, he devotes himself more to art. He takes singing lessons, performs in public in artistic demonstrations (singing, poem, etc.).

He performs in dubious scenes and bad taste. He will even ask for an edition of Greek games. He will then go to Greece, in a kind of crusade in the name of art where he took 6000 archers, musician, actors. Gladiator combats does not interest him and he will limit the practice.

Nero then begins to irritate the aristocrats and some of them plot to annihilate him.

## The death of Nero {class="blog_post_title"}

Nero got wind of plots and had several aristocrats assassinated or forced to suicide. He becomes emotional and often makes anxiety attacks.

Opposition rises against him. He then mobilizes his generals and wins a first victory against the rebels.

He would have had kept control of the situation by mobilizing his troops and carrying out concrete actions against the rebels. Instead, he continued to devote himself to his art, which gave the rebel troops a lot of time.

He was told that his most faithful servants turned their back on him, he believed that and decided to flee.

He will end up committing suicide by sinking a dagger in his throat. His last words, ‚ÄúWhat a great artist disappears with me‚Äù

## The story not so true ‚Ä¶ {class="blog_post_title"}

The story of Nero is written by Tacitus, Suetone, Dio Cassius. Not only these three are known to exaggerate their stories, but they hate Nero. That leads us to believe that several facts related to the life of Nero, including the fact that he caused the fire, are only pure inventions.

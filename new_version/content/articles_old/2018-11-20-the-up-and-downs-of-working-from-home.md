## Imagine the possibility of working from the place you like the most. Where will you work? In the middle of nature? On the edge of a lake ? On your bed? or in any place that stimulates your inspiration? **To be able to work remotely is to benefit from this choice.** {class="blog_post_subtitle"}

&nbsp;

Remote work brings a lot of benefits, and i intend to talk about it because i have myself experienced it more than once. I would therefore focus on my personal experience. If you have ever had a job of this kind, I invite you to share your experience in the comments.

<span class = "blog_post_para_title" >What is it?¬†</span>

The concept is quite simple : **to do your professional activity remotely**. Whether at home or from Jupiter (That&#8217;s where i go most of the time&#8230;), the possibilities are endless. It may happen that some companies require, or prefer that you are in a given country for any reason. But in general space is not a constraint, time is a little more, but again it depends.

&nbsp;

<span class = "blog_post_para_title">How it works ?¬†¬†</span>

The demands of a remote work are the same as an office work

  * **Timing** :¬†You will be required to work during a time period. very often it&#8217;s the famous 9 to 5, or the 40 hours per week but it depends on each contract. It&#8217;s much more flexible in general since you will not necessarily be in the same time zone as your employer. You are generally free to start at the time of your convenience
  * **Good internet**: Obviously, remote work is possible thanks to the communication technologies which operate thanks to the internet. Slack, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Whatsapp and so on. To communicate with your colleagues these tools will be needed, and these tools work better with a very good internet. You don&#8217;t want to start a Skype call and lose 15 minutes asking the same question again and again.

<span style="font-size: 32px;" class ="blog_post_para_title" >The PROS</span>

The PROS are numerous, and they can vary from one person to another. I am thinking in particular of mothers who can manage their homes at the same time, spend more time with their children. Freelancers who can give time to other activities. Remote work can be beneficial for anyone but not always for the same reasons. But I&#8217;m going to talk about my own point of view, and the benefits it brings me.

  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">1. Better sleep¬†üò¥</span>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  I am absolutely serious. The consequences of a lack of sleep on an organism are disastrous. That&#8217;s why sleep is a sacred practice. I&#8217;m sure that sometimes in the morning when you get up, you sometimes have this reaction:

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  When your alarm rings at 6 am and you hate the whole world for tearing you appart from this sweet pleasure. And then you try to scrounge a few extra minutes &#8230; I understand you so much, indeed it&#8217;s unfair. It&#8217;s been a while since i no longer set alarms. I trust entirely my biological clock. My body knows how much time it&#8217;s need to heal and I grant it with pleasure. No more alarm!

  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">2. More free time¬†‚åö</span>
</p>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2018 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/giphy-2-1.gif?resize=360%2C202&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="360" height="202" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Working from home saves valuable time. Normal, you don&#8217;t have to go to an office, you are at the office wherever you are. No matter how far your workplace is from your home, it will always require some time to prepare and move around. If your workplace is very far away, we are talking about hours. An hour or two unnecessarily lost in traffic, it&#8217;s such a waste when you think about it. Also if you finish earlier, no one will judge you if you stop working. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve already felt uncomfortable or guilty about leaving your workplace before everyone else. And there are many who stay in the office pretending to work after they have actually finished their tasks. If your work from home, finishing early means having time to do other things.

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  So far, if you do not have to move, farewell transportation and fuel costs. Goodbye restaurants menus every day. Working from home allows you to earn a good salary while reducing your expenses considerably. And on top of that, the company that hires you takes charge of your internet subscription and some other bills related to work.

  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">4. More freedom¬†üïä</span>
</p><figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1991 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/giphy-1.gif?w=1170&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure> 

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of freedom is a picture shared by one of my colleagues one day. That day he was near a lake, with his MacBook, quietly doing his daily tasks. The caption with his picture was &#8220;Best job of the world&#8221;. No more, no less. This is THE biggest advantage of working remotely and at the same time it&#8217;s the concept. Ability to work from anywhere and sometimes anytime. It happened to me when I wanted to go to my parents to stay for a few days. Incidentally I made even more savings than usual because being housed and fed. But having the ability to work from anywhere gives you a wide range of options. Some of my colleagues opted for a co-working space, it can do the trick for those who want to run into an office atmosphere.
</p>

<span class = "blog_post_para_title">But&#8230;</span>

**Everything is not perfect**, sorry if you&#8217;ve believed it so far. But even remote work **has its bad aspects**. When I told my entourage that I was doing my work from home, it was common to hear phrases like, &#8220;oh but that&#8217;s the dream!&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s the best work of the world! &#8220;,&#8221; if only I could have it &#8230; &#8220;. It&#8217;s a notion that gives rise to a lot of fantasies, and that&#8217;s why we can&#8217;t perceive the bad sides from the beginning , and yet there are some &#8230;

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">Forever alone</span>
</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/xT0GqeV6pCFWI6fw8E/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C267&#038;ssl=1" width="480" height="267" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Social life, it&#8217;s complicated. Sometimes you feel alone in the world, locked between 4 walls. For me it was a bit complicated the first months. I was not used to it at all. In the office we can talk to each others, discuss everything, make plans together for the weekends &#8230;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Of course there are always people we do not like to see, sometimes ego battles, or difficult superiors when we share the same space 8 hours per day. But being able to interact with others is still essential for us, weak humans.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Yes, there is the co-working option. In addition, in my case as for others, the costs of subscription to a co-working space can be took in charge by the employer. But this solution did not suit me for several reasons. The major reason is the internet. One of the requirements of remote work. I once had the experience of co-working, the internet was not great. Imagine about twenty people sharing a network. Some people can start downloading their movie of the day, we have no control over that and it&#8217;s a real problem.

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">Days off are depression and anxiety</span>
</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/8TJK6prvRXF6g/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C340&#038;ssl=1" width="480" height="340" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  I used to love days off. It was days when I had the right to spend the morning in bed, to stay at home doing nothing, to watch good series. Now, these are just ordinary days when I just get bored more than usual. It has happened to me that working is itching on a holiday. And even during some weekends sometimes.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">Too much noises¬†</span>
</p>

<img class="aligncenter " src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/APbcWKvZf5ka7hU19j/source.gif?resize=458%2C305&#038;ssl=1" width="458" height="305" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  It can also happen in an office but less often because it&#8217;s workplace. When you&#8217;re at home, you&#8217;re not in a workplace. Many things can disturb. The carpenter who comes to repair a door, the dog who does not stop barking during a call, children who run and shout in all directions &#8230; But at least we can move, we can adapt but sometimes it can be problematic.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">Opportunities are missing</span><span class = "blog_post_para_title"><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/l41lFw057lAJQMwg0/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Although it is growing more and more, it&#8217;s still rare to find a good opportunity of remote work. And besides, it depends on the field in which you are. All digital professions, like community manager, graphic designer, developper, SEO and so on, it&#8217;s quite easy to find a remote work because all you need for doing those jobs is a computer. While pharmacist for example, working remotely is going to be complicated &#8230; For now, remote work is not compatible with all jobs in the world. But with the technologies that never stop evolving, I hope that more and more fields get involved.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <span class = "blog_post_para_title">Weak contracts¬†¬†</span>
</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/39oZZ4lmn51Sw/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C288&#038;ssl=1" width="480" height="288" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Again this is not a generality, but work remotely does not rhyme with permanent contract. Especially if you work for a company that is not in the same country as you, you are paid for your service, that&#8217;s it. Social security, health insurance, retirement, only things you will not be entitled to. You can subscribe to it independently, but you&#8217;ll have to pay for it.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Working remotely is being more responsible, you must save some money and pay taxes alone. And in some countries, these taxes can make you scream. Sometimes you will need to set up a company to legalize your business if the independent status does not exist in the country where you practice. And since your contract does not protect you that much, you are easily &#8220;fireable&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  In the opposite of a permanent employee where legal issues are added on the table, as a independent contractor, your employer can fire you overnight without problems or consequences, it happened to some of my colleagues. This adds extra pressure when you know it&#8217;s the biggest fear for an employee.
</p>

I will be honest with you, despite its few flaws, the remote work is a **real discovery for me**. So far, it&#8217;s what I prefer. This is not the case for everyone, because I know colleagues who hate being isolated. But I think it&#8217;s better for several reasons. It gives you more options simply. It&#8217;s a bit of the **manual mode of work**, and it&#8217;s great. You organize yourself freely and as you hear it and that&#8217;s really good.

**And you ? Have you once worked remotely? How was it ?** For those who wish to have a remote work opportunity, send me an email on osu@senseibara.com, specifying the position you are looking for. Beware if it&#8217;s outside technical/digital fields I&#8217;m not sure I can help.

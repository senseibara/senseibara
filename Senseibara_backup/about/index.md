I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment.

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a [thousand unknown][1] plants are noticed.

      Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don&#8217;t resist them &#8211; that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.Â

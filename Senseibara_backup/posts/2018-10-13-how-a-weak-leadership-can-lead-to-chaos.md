Thirty children alone on a desert island. Initially they regroup, elect a leader, organize themselves for survival. In the end they kill each other without scruple. These are just the results of fragile leadership.

I love books, but I read very few novels. This is not the kind that interests me the most. But I admit that novels sometimes have this ability to clarify abstract concepts of real life with concrete examples.

The context that led to this analogy is: _The chaotic organization of a team whose creation is improvised_. These teams can initially be very disoriented, the ideal opportunity for potential leaders to take the power and lead the boat. But, this boat can quickly capsize in the troubled waters when storms or moments of crisis begin to spring.

<div class="reading1">
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    The lord of flies, is not about flies at all. It&#8217;s the story of a group of children stuck on a desert island after a plane crash. No adult, survived, and they are left to their own devices. Those who know LOST it&#8217;s basically the same but with children.
  </p>
</div>

&nbsp;

At first they are completely disoriented and mostly scattered on the island. They have no means of communication until &#8230; A small group of two children, Ralph and Piggy, found a conch. (This is a shell that can produce a sound when you blow in it). Ralph, picks up the conch and blows in it.

One by one, the children appeared. There saw also a choir formed of fifteen children and directed by someone called Jack Merridew. Soon they began to talk about organization for survival, and it was not long before **the question at the center of interest** finally jumped:

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">Who is going to be the chief ?</span>

&nbsp;

 <img class="size-full wp-image-2161 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineen.png?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineen.png?w=400&ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineen.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineen.png?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" />For Jack who is very authoritarian, impetuous and egocentric, he should be elected because he is already leading the choir. The choir represents about 1/3 of all children.

The majority elected Ralph as their leader thought after a vote. Ralph is the one who blew into the conch and got them all together, so he deserves this title more, to Jack&#8217;s dismay.

As a good diplomat, Ralph gives carte blanche to jack on the functions he wants to take with his choir which he can keep the leadership. That&#8217;s how the choir becomes the hunting team.

Ralph then establishes a democratic system where anyone can speak only if they have the conch in their hands. And when the sound of the conch is heard, it means that all the kids are convoked for a group talk.

One of the biggest weaknesses of this structure and that will be destructive is a **very poor definition of roles and priorities**. What is the most important when you are lost on a desert island?

To be able to feed oneself to survive?
  
Ensuring the permanence of sending distress signals to attract relief?
  
Protect yourself from a monster who, according to some witnesses, rode in the island?

**<span style="font-size: 21px;">These three points are the main political concerns of the island, the one who is able to solve them, holds the power.</span>**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">Hunting¬†üî™üèπ</span>

For the children to have enough food, Jack and his troop hunt the little pigs that are numerous on the Island. This activity will become predominant in the collective consciousness because it is the only one that is at the same time playful, sporting and important.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">Fire¬†üî•</span>

Thanks to the glasses worn by Piggy, the children manage to make a campfire. For passing planes and ships to be able to detect their presence, the campfire must always remain lit and maintained as a signal. Jack undertakes to maintain the fire with his troop of hunters. Especially since the fire also makes it possible to roast the pigs caught during the hunt.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">The monster¬†üëπüëª</span>

A child suddenly declares to have seen a terrifying monster on the island. If this makes some people laugh at first, they are gradually caught by their overflowing imagination and fear takes hold of them.A group, gone to chase the monster, finally confirm its existence after seeing a strange body on a cliff. Jack and his team, who master the hunt well, declare themselves protector of the group against the monster with their wooden spears.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">Have you noticed ?¬†</span>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2162 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefinejacken.png?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefinejacken.png?w=400&ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefinejacken.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefinejacken.png?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Jack is on all major fronts, so he holds the power. He is the only one to ensure the 3 things that matter most. Having too much responsibility, his group struggles to ensure everything efficiently. While they go hunting, the rest of the group including Ralph sees a plane pass over them but without noticing them because the fire was out.

Returning proud of having brought some meat, Jack arrives with his troop, gloating and praising his feats of good hunter to impress Ralph. But Ralph reprimands him more than anything because of the extinction of the fire. By letting the fire go out, jack failed to one of his responsibilities, and Ralph was disappointed.

Jack then begins to tire of Ralph&#8217;s orders, Ralph who &#8220;do nothing but give orders&#8221;, he can&#8217;t hunt and have no authority. Jack decides to separate from the group to form his own tribe. He promises all those who follow him, meat and feasts at will. The hunters naturally followed him, and the group splits into two.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">And that, is the beginning of chaos.</span>

The tribe of jack becomes uncontrollable and bloodthirsty. Hunting is no more just an activity, but a whole obscure and pagan ritual. The hunters paint their faces and bodies, pronounce sacred formulas, make sacrifices to the monster.

The organization of the tribe is similar to that of a gang or a mafia family. It&#8217;s fundamentally based on **division of labor** and **hierarchical authority**. Members who fails in their duty are stripped, beaten and isolated. But above all, they hold all the powers and resources of the island.

They have food, they have the weapons to hunt and protect themselves from the monster, and they end up also with the fire by attacking the other group to steal Piggy&#8217;s glasses. Ralph&#8217;s group shrinks little by little, weakens, and loses all its resources. It is impossible for them to survive.

The only card left for them to play is **negotiation**. By speaking with Jack and calling to his good sense maybe he will agree to return to Piggy his glasses because they belong to him and he can not see without them. BIG mistake ! **DO NOT negotiate by calling for mercy, Offer something in return**.

Jack obviously refuses, and things go wrong. Ralph and jack start to fight. What remains of Ralph&#8217;s group is captured and tied up. Piggy ,trying desperately to reason Jack and Ralph, gets brutally murdered by the jack henchmen. Shocked, Ralph finally flees.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">Ralph&#8217;s mistake</span>

The structure that Ralph tried to put in place collapsed little by little because it was very vulnerable from the start. W**hat were his mistakes, according to you?**

IMO, Ralph&#8217;s leadership has always been limited to the conch. This same conch made him the leader, and around this same conch he built rules of gathering and speaking. It&#8217;s far from enough to handle a group of children.

<img class="size-full wp-image-2163 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineporcineten.png?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineporcineten.png?w=400&ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineporcineten.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/senseibara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/charadefineporcineten.png?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Ralph has, from the outset, **poorly defined and distributed the roles**. The group of hunters ¬†are doing everything, the other children do not do much.

Ralph has also made the mistake that a lot of managers commit, **he limits his work to his title**. By just giving directions and calling meetings that are not productive, he gives the impression of having no talent to help in the tasks that matter, and is struggling to coordinate effectively to make them move forward.

His sense of command is far too weak and most of the time he does not know what to do. He is often advised by Piggy.

Piggy, who is chubby and a little weak, is very clever on the other hand. He plays the perfect role of the sidekick. He is close to Ralph, helps him put into perspective in the difficult moments, and strongly supports him in his decisions.

The organization of Ralph and Piggy could have worked to a certain point. But the occurrence of major problems and especially the monster, plunged the island into a crisis that this lax and hesitant organization could not contain. The stammering and loss of control are not effective in the face of the anxiety that is created. And conversely, Jack&#8217;s organization is very enterprising and reactive in a chaotic situation. That&#8217;s what brought every kid in his tribe.

<span style="font-family: 'Bree Serif'; font-size: 32px;">Finally</span>

In fact neither of these two organizations is good, even though in this critical situation, the tribe of jack was the best equipped to survive. We reach two extremes to avoid. On one side there is no rigor on the other there is too much. **We have to find a good balance for better leadership**.

It&#8217;s also necessary to know the priority and to make everyone agree on it , in order to not disperse the efforts too much. Ralph had a clear purpose from the beginning: to leave the island. This goal has remained the same throughout despite all the bad weather. It&#8217;s a very good thing. A good captain must always stay the course. What he lacked was influence to achieve his ends. Jack on the other hand had this influence, but his ego is so big that he loses sight of the most important thing. He no longer cares to be rescued and persists in his delusions of grandeur.

**And you ? What do you think ? What does this story inspire you? Have you been witness to a similar situation?** Tell me everything in the comments.
